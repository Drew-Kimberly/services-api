# We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
# choice for the user. This makes it more likely that the charts will run successfully on
# environments with few resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources,
# uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
#
# These can be modified on a per-environment basis. E.g, you may want to specify
# more resources for the production environments than for test environments.
# limits:
#   cpu: 100m
#   memory: 128Mi
# requests:
#   cpu: 100m
#   memory: 128Mi
